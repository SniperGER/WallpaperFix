# WallpaperFix
Fixes custom wallpapers not appearing in Settings

Since iOS 12, custom wallpapers stored in /Library/Wallpapers won't appear in Settings when choosing a new wallpaper.

This tweak allows you to store custom wallpapers in /Library/Wallpapers again and lets you use iOS' "special handling" (eg. centering and zoom) of system wallpapers for your own.

Custom wallpapers are always appended to the list *after* stock wallpapers.
